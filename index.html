  <h2>Your Poem</h2>
  <div class="poem">
    <p class="poem-text">
Noticed In Silence, Her Keepsake Awoke


Near your name, I hovered, never pressed,
A message typed, then backspaced and suppressed.
The “okay” you dropped stayed loud inside my screen,
More felt in pause than anything you mean.

Inked in soft green shirts and black that flows,
In blue that walked where every question goes.
I sent you sweets — you laughed and left it there,
But something lingered warm between the air.

Silence wrapped you close like a soft refrain,
The way you’d speak in quiet made me strain.
Your “hehehe” — too casual to be deep —
Still echoed in the way I couldn't sleep.

Her faith stood firm while mine dissolved in why,
You knelt in grace, I questioned every sky.
Yet still I watched you fold your hands and knew
That doubt in me still bowed in front of you.

Kind were not your words, but what you left —
A half-sent reel, a typing pause, a theft.
I called you “great,” you rolled your eyes and sighed,
But saved the praise beneath your sideways pride.

Aura wasn’t light — it was your shade,
The quiet moves, the way your silence played.
You never said too much, and yet you shone,
In every part of you I met alone.


Now each “maybe” I reread like prose,
You meant “yes” once — I felt it, I suppose.
You’d tease and change the subject halfway through,
But I still caught the part you thought I knew.

I knew your silence more than you suspect,
Each “ok” text I took apart, unchecked.
You said “good going” once — and just that line
Stayed longer than replies you left behind.

She sent a reel, said, “Know yourself?” and smiled,
I watched and wrote, and overthought it wild.
You said, “Perhaps,” then typed a stray “hmm” too —
A joke to you, a journey to go through.

Her word “lite” held more than she would show,
I mocked it, then just watched the silence grow.
A skill, a shrug, a reel, a vanishing grace —
She left, but left the stillness in her place.

Kept each chat that sounded just like rain,
The trickle of her meaning wrapped in plain.
A “thank you” here, a “demnn” I didn’t miss —
Each half-reply felt full enough as bliss.

And if she finds these verses in a scroll,
Don't blink and guess, don't wonder if you stole
A thought or two that sounds like something true.
Don’t wonder if it’s you.
It is.
It always was you.
